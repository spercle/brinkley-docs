# Contributing

## Why Contribute?

- **Community Building:** Engage with others who use or benefit from the documentation.

## How You Can Contribute

The Unofficial Brinkley Documentation site is an actively maintained and constantly evolving project. 

Our ever-growing community includes many active users who open new issues and discussions several times a day, evolving our [issue tracker] and [discussion board] into a knowledge base - an important addition to our [documentation] - yielding value to both new and experienced users.

We understand that reporting bugs, raising change requests, and engaging in discussions can be time-consuming, which is why we've carefully optimized our issue templates and defined guidelines to improve the overall interaction within the project. We've invested a lot of time and effort into making our [issue tracker] and [discussion board] as efficient as possible.

Our goal is to ensure that our documentation, as well as issue tracker and discussion board, are **well-structured**, **easy to navigate**, and **searchable**, so you can find what you need quickly and efficiently. Thus, when you follow our guidelines, we can help you much faster.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

**What to Do:** If you notice typos, outdated information, or any other issues, report them using GitHub's issue tracking feature.

**How to Do It:**
- Visit the GitHub repository for the documentation.
- Under the "Issues" tab, click "New Issue".
- Describe the problem or suggest improvements. Use clear, concise language.
- Label the issue appropriately (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "question") if labels are set up by the maintainers.

### 2. Suggesting Edits

**What to Do:** If you know how to fix or improve something, you can suggest edits directly.

**How to Do It:**
- Navigate to the page you want to edit.
- Look for an "Edit on GitHub" link if available, or go directly to the GitHub repository.
- Find the corresponding file in the `docs` folder (e.g., `docs/your-page.md`).
- Click on the pencil icon to edit the file directly on GitHub.
- After making changes, describe them in the commit message and submit a pull request.

### 3. Writing New Content

**What to Do:** If there's something missing that you think should be included, write it.

**How to Do It:**
- Follow the same process as suggesting edits but instead, create a new `.md` file in the `docs` folder.
- Use simple Markdown to format your text (headings, lists, links). Here's a quick primer:
  ```markdown
  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  - Bullet point
  - Another bullet
