# Model G

## Luxury Fifth Wheel Toy Haulers

Introducing the Brinkley Model G, developed & tested by RVers to create a Toy Hauler Without Compromise. The first fifth wheel toy hauler from Brinkley is the culmination of decades of experience, countless hours of research and development, and feedback from customers and fellow RVers.

With one virtual prototype and three physical prototypes, the Model G has been put through its paces, traveling thousands of miles and undergoing dozens of tests. The result is a high-quality RV that is both luxurious and functional, perfect for any adventure that we are proud to call a Brinkley.

The Brinkley Model G line is much more than just a Luxury Fifth-Wheel Toy Hauler! The G line is packed with intelligently designed features, an automotive exterior, and a true residential interior thatâ€™s unmatched.
