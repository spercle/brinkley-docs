# SEC.03 **SERVICE & WARRANTY**

## A. DEALER'S RESPONSIBILITIES

At the time your Brinkley RV is purchased, your Dealer is expected to:

- **1. DELIVER your RV in the best condition possible.** Your RV must pass the Dealer's Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI). This inspection tests all systems and components. No Brinkley RV should leave a Dealer's lot without first ensuring that all systems and components are in proper working order.
- **2. PROVIDE an orientation to familiarize you with how to operate all systems and components of your new RV.** This orientation is extremely important to ensuring you understand how to properly use the RV prior to camping. Brinkley RV requires its Dealers to provide you with a comprehensive walk through of the RV prior to you leaving their Dealership. You should ask as many questions as possible to ensure you are prepared to safely utilize your Brinkley RV and that you are trained on the use of all the features of the RV. Please contact us directly if the orientation is not completed to your satisfaction.

    THE ORIENTATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE RV PURCHASE PROCESS. This is your opportunity to ask as many questions as possible. The most common frustrations generally result from a lack of understanding how to properly use the various systems of the RV as well as a basic understanding of how the batteries and electrical systems work.

- **3. REVIEW with you and explain the provisions of the Limited Base Warranty and Limited Structural Warranty.** It is our goal to ensure that you understand your rights and responsibilities to gain the complete benefit of the warranties afforded to you. These warranties, as well as the additional
component and appliance warranties, are summarized in the separate Brinkley RV Warranty Guide. If you have questions, please contact us.

- **4. SEND your completed Warranty Registration and New Vehicle PDI Checklist to Brinkley RV.** Your Warranty Registration Form is required to be submitted within fourteen (14) days of the RV delivery date to activate your warranty coverage. We expect every Brinkley RV Authorized Dealer to assist you with your warranty registrations and to complete this process prior to you leaving the Dealership. We expect the registrations will be completed by the Dealer on the actual date of purchase. We provide fourteen (14) days from the purchase date to ensure you are afforded adequate time to register. Please contact us immediately if your Dealer did not assist you in registering your warranties.
- **5. ENSURE that you receive a complete Owner Information Package**. Your Dealer must ensure that you obtain a copy of the Brinkley RV Owner's Manual, individual component manuals, and Warranty Guide.
- **6. EXPLAIN how to obtain local and out-of-town service for your RV, and its components and appliances.** It is our goal to ensure you know how to obtain service regardless of whether or not the service is covered by your warranties. If your RV has an issue, we want to ensure that it is promptly fixed. You can always contact us directly at any time for assistance.
- **7. SERVICE all Brinkley RV products.** Each and every Brinkley RV Authorized Dealership is required to provide service on all Brinkley RV products. RVs are intended to permit you to travel across North America and explore all it has to offer. If you are traveling and cannot access your selling Dealership, please consult our website for both a Dealer and Mobile Service Locator or call Brinkley Customer Care for assistance.

If you do not register your RV within the required timeframes, warranty may be forfeited.

## B. OWNER'S (YOUR) RESPONSIBILITIES

Routine care and maintenance of your RV is a part of owning your Brinkley RV. The conditions of the roads and highways you encounter as well as exposure to weather and the elements can all take a toll on the condition of your RV. As such, it is your responsibility to care and maintain your Brinkley RV in accordance with the Warranty Guide, component manuals, and this manual. Proper maintenance will improve the longevity of your RV and will prevent situations where warranty coverage is lost due to neglect.

In the circumstance warranty repairs and/or service is needed, it is your responsibility to transport the RV to and from your Authorized Dealer. We ask that you always first attempt to obtain the needed warranty service work through your selling Brinkley RV Dealer. However, if this is not possible for any given reason, Brinkley RV is more than willing to assist you in locating alternatives. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time. It is also highly recommended that you obtain insurance coverage on your RV. This coverage will afford you protection for or against personal liability, collision, theft, property damage, etc.

## C. OBTAINING WARRANTY SERVICE

In the event you feel you need to take your RV to an Authorized Dealer for service work of any kind, please first follow the steps below to validate your concern and to obtain service work:

- **1. Verify your complaint.** There is nothing more frustrating than transporting your RV to your Dealer just to find out your RV is operating correctly, is functioning within normal conditions of the RV, or was not used correctly. There are many instances where your Dealer or Brinkley RV can help you before you become frustrated and spend time trying to obtain service.
- **2. Make a list.** If service is truly required, you should also make a prioritized list of all repairs needed and provide this list to the Dealer or Authorized Service Center at the time of scheduling service. We want to ensure that the Dealer or Authorized Service Center schedules enough time to address all your service concerns and they can obtain all necessary parts in advance of your service appointment. The checklist will also help to ensure that the Dealer addresses all your concerns at the time of service.

!!! qoute "Notice"

    It is very common for service to be delayed due to the parts not being available at the time of service. RV Dealers generally carry many different brands and models of RV's making it difficult to stock all parts required for service. Some replacement parts may take several weeks for the Dealer or Authorized Service Center to obtain. The better you communicate your service needs, the better your service experience will be.

- **3. Be prepared.** Prior to calling your Dealer or Brinkley RV, make sure you have your warranty list prepared, the VIN, and any related past service/maintenance paperwork available. Being prepared is critical to ensuring speedy and accurate resolution of your service issues.
- **4. Call ahead.** Due to demand, it is best to contact your Dealer to schedule your service appointment several weeks prior to using your RV. Please take into the account that if parts are needed, repair time may be extended. Holiday schedules may also impact scheduling time.

- **5. Drop off your RV.** Dealers will ask for your RV to be dropped off. This will give them time to properly verify your complaint, identify the cause, and make the correction. Note that there are also instances where service may be able to be performed by a mobile technician. Calling ahead to confirm whether drop-off is required will save you time and reduce frustration.
- **6. Inspect your RV at pick-up.** Prior to picking up your unit, inspect all repairs thoroughly. It is vital to address any concerns or dissatisfaction immediately. You should feel empowered to ask as many questions as you have related to your RV service as your satisfaction is of the utmost importance. If a problem reoccurs after leaving the Dealership, contact the Dealer's Service Manager along with Brinkley RV, to quickly address and resolve the issue.
