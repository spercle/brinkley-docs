# SEC.26 **RV EXTERIOR CARE**

## A. GENERAL

The exterior portion of the RV is composed of many materials including, but not limited to: Fiberglass, automotive paints, plastics, sealant, aluminum, and rubber.

The longer a foreign substance remains on the finish of the RV, the more likely it is to damage it. It is recommended that you keep the exterior of the RV cleaned and maintained on a continuous basis. This can be accomplished by frequently washing and waxing the RV with the recommendations outlined in the below sections.

The following materials may cause damage to the surface of the RV resulting in corrosion, staining, chemical spotting, and premature wear:

- Road dirt, dust, and debris Including, but not limited to, road salt, de-icing chemicals, tar, gravel, oils, and other automotive fluids.
- Tree sap, bird feces or droppings, and bugs.
- UV exposure, humidity, and moisture.
- Industrial fallout, hail, acidic rain, and other possible pollutants.

# B. EXTERIOR CLEANING

Frequently washing the RV can help to protect it against environmental elements, such as acids, debris, and/or salts commonly found in air, water, and snow, and de-icing chemicals.

- Any time the RV encounters foreign materials, the RV should be washed.
- Try to avoid parking under trees, near saltwater bodies of water, or in direct sunlight.
- When ice or snow is present, never scrape the surface of the RV to remove, always brush snow and ice off with a soft bristle snow broom.
- If chemicals or solvents such as anti-freeze, gasoline, oil, etc. encounter the surface of the RV, rinse the affected area immediately.
- Bird and insect droppings should be rinsed off daily.

## C. WASHING

- Never wash the RV in direct sunlight. Park in a shaded area and allow the RV surface to cool before washing.
- First spray the RV with water to remove loose dust and debris.
- Next, wash the RV.
	- Use a mild car wash detergent and water mixture.
	- Use a soft debris-free washing mitt or sponge.
	- Wash from the top down of the RV.
- Once fully washed, the RV should be thoroughly rinsed.
- Upon rinsing, immediately dry with a chamois or soft cloth.
- Joints, flanges, wiper seals, doors, etc. should be carefully hand cleaned to remove hidden or covered dirt and debris.
- **NEVER** use an automatic car wash on the RV.
	- Excessive heat may distort materials and cause resins to become damaged.
	- Excessive pressure may cause water to flood undesired areas within the RV.
- Avoid using high pressure water systems to clean the RV. This may force water into the RV.
- When using any form of pressure sprayer, extreme caution should be used near or around any door, attachment, window, vent, appliance, etc.
- Keep the tip of the sprayer roughly 16 inches or further away from the surface of the RV.
- If hazing or chalking occurs, wash, and wax a small trial area to see if luster returns.
- Have the RV inspected by your Dealer if the exterior becomes cracked or nicked.



## D. DURING COLD WEATHER

If the slide-out room, compartment door, or entry door becomes frozen shut, do not force it open. Doing so may result in damage to the seals, gaskets, and slide components. If seals become damaged, they will no longer be weatherproof.

#### **To open:**

- Apply warm water on the gasket or seal to melt the ice. Do not use boiled or hot water.
- Once the ice melts and the door or slide-out can be opened, thoroughly dry all water present.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Salt and other chemicals utilized on roads during winter months may cause damage to the RV and should be rinsed immediately. Rust may form if it is not cleaned from the metal surfaces and will not be warrantable.

#### **When exposed to salts and other chemicals during winter:**

- Rinse the under portion of the RV (frame, axles, axle hangers, pinbox, LP lines, etc.) and all other parts of the RV that may have been exposed.
- After rinsing the RV, dry all water from all doors, slide-outs, and rubber seals or gaskets.

## E. RV WAXING

The RV should be waxed once or twice a year, or when water no longer beads upon the surface of the RV. Take a soft cloth and apply a small amount of wax to the surface of the entire RV.

- Never wax in direct sunlight.
- If surfaces are warm, allow them to cool before beginning.
- Do not apply wax to weather stripping or rivets.
- If the wax stains the surface, remove with a warm water and a soft cloth.
- Once the wax is fully dry, hand buff the RV with a dry, soft cloth.
- Repeat this process until the desired results are obtained.

!!! quote "Notice"
    DO NOT use a buffing compound or buffer on the surface of the RV as it may damage the exterior surface. If further assistance is needed, please contact your local RV body professional.

## F. RV POLISHING

If the painted surfaces of the RV dull over time, are damaged, or lose their color, a mild polishing compound can be used. Polish a larger area than that of the damaged area to help to blend in the polished area. After the area has been treated with polish, thoroughly remove the polish from the surface and re-apply a coat of wax.

## G. DAMAGED PAINT

After returning from a trip, all surfaces exposed to the road or near the tires should be inspected for paint damage that may have resulted from debris. If painted areas become damaged, they should be touched-up as soon as possible with touch-up film or paint. To purchase touch-up films or paints, please reach out to your closest automotive facility capable of matching paint. Please also refer to **Section 26N** (next page) pertaining to the RV frame/chassis.


## H. PLASTIC COMPONENTS

To clean plastic components, use a soft cloth, sponge, or chamois with warm water. Refrain from using abrasive cleaning tools, soaps, or waxes as they may cause damage to the surface of the plastic components.

## I. CHROME PARTS (IF EQUIPPED)

To prevent spotting or corrosion from occurring on chrome parts, always pat dry when exposed to moisture. When washed, rinse with water, thoroughly dry, and apply a non-abrasive wax for protection. If the chrome becomes severely damaged or pitted, chrome polishes can be utilized.

## J. EXTERIOR ROOF

The Superflex Alpha Ply membrane and vents on the roof should be inspected and cleaned twice a year with a mild soap and water solution.

- When cleaning the surface of the roof, refrain from using sharp tools (such as a putty knife) that could puncture or tear the membrane.
- All areas should be cleaned with a medium scrub brush.
- Once fully clean, rinse with water and allow the surface to air dry.
- If seals need to be reapplied, clean the area with a non-abrasive household cleaner first (i.e., Spic-N-Span).
	- Always prep and re-seal an area **AFTER** the roof has already been washed.
	- Cleaners and solvents should **NOT** be used in the washing stage. Cleaners and solvents may damage existing seals or cause premature breakdown.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Never use petroleum distillates when washing the roof. This may cause irreversible damage.

!!! warning
    **When on the roof, do so with great caution and navigate the area on your hands and knees. This will help to distribute your weight and reduce your risk of falling. As the water and mild soap solution are applied to the roof material, it can become very slippery.**

## K. SIDEWALL VENTS

There are various vents and appliance access panels that will need to be kept clean and clear of debris and obstructions. Holding tank vents will also need to be regularly inspected for possible obstructions caused by birds, insects, leaves, etc.

## L. SEALANTS

There are many forms of sealants used on your RV including butyl tape, putty, encapsulated foam, silicone, roof sealant and Eternabond tapes. Each sealant has its own unique way to help protect your RV.

Although many seals do not have a set lifespan, due to environmental factors, deterioration may occur over time. If signs of deterioration are present, please replace the seal immediately to prevent possible damages.

Exterior sealants should be inspected every six (6) months and replaced as needed every year.



Please contact your Dealer or Brinkley RV Customer Care for a copy of the Brinkley RV Seals Guide.

#### **Dealer Expectation:**

- Inspect ALL sealants every three (3) months the RV is on lot and replace as needed.
- Replace all seals once a year as required as preventative care.
- Resolve any water damage that occurred due to the lack of preventative care.

**If water is present inside the RV, immediately inspect the RV for leaks. If the origin of the leak cannot be determined and remedied, have your Dealer inspect the RV right away. Failure to properly maintain the RV or to correct a leak may result in extensive damage to the RV and is not deemed warrantable.** 

Please contact your Dealer or Brinkley RV with any questions, or concerns that you have.

## M. ROOF LADDER

There is a roof access, side mount ladder provided with the RV and is stored within the pullout storage found under the main pass-through storage on the off door side (driver's side). This will allow you to gain access to the roof. The roof contains decking under the rubber roof membrane that will allow you to walk on the roof to perform maintenance. This should be performed with caution.

!!! warning
    **The installed ladder is capable of handling up to 300 lbs (136.08 kg). When in transit, no items should be attached to the ladder at any time.** 

## N. RV FRAME/CHASSIS

Road debris, rocks, automotive fluids, sand, salts, and other road chemicals may cause damage to the frame's exterior paint. As its' protective coating becomes compromised, the frame becomes susceptible to rust and other forms of deterioration.

Regularly inspect all exposed areas of the frame and repaint compromised areas after thoroughly cleaning.

## O. WINDOWS

Condensation and heavy rains may allow water to accumulate within the window track. Regularly dry and clean this area to prevent mildew from forming.

The glass within the window can be cleaned using a glass cleaner and soft cloth or paper towel. After being cleaned, the glass should be dried with another soft, dry cloth.

- 1. Inspect the roof and all other surfaces for damage that may pose a threat for water to seep into the RV. Such leaks may go unnoticed until damage is already done.
- 2. Ensure all windows, roof vents, compartment doors, and entry doors are securely closed.



## P. RAMP DOORS AND PATIO RAIL KITS

The exterior of the ramp door should be cleaned in the same manner as the exterior walls of the RV. The interior of the ramp door can be cleaned with soap and water and a soft bristle brush to help remove dirt and debris from the interior textured surface.

The Patio Rail Kit should also be kept clean and free from dirt and debris. Warm soap and water can be utilized. Towel dry after cleaning. Lubricate moving parts as needed.

## Q. RV STORAGE PREPARATION

To help prevent problems from occurring, you should always prepare the RV before placing it in storage over extended periods of time. This preparation will not only protect your RV, but it will also make the process of removing the RV from storage much easier to accomplish.

- 1. Inspect the roof and all other surfaces for damage that may lead to water leaks or damage.
- 2. Ensure all windows, roof vents, compartment doors, and entry doors are securely closed.
- 3. Turn OFF the power to the refrigerator.
	- a. Once defrosted, the freezer and refrigerator should be cleaned.
	- b. Place baking soda and crumpled newspapers in the refrigerator to help eliminate odors.
	- c. Disconnect the ice-maker and drain the line.
- 4. Clean and empty the external mini refrigerator and place baking soda and crumpled paper inside the refrigerator to help eliminate odors.
- 5. Fully shut the propane cylinder valve(s).
- 6. Cover all external vents, exhausts, air conditioner, and outlets with mud dauber/rodent screens to prevent rodents from entering.

#### **THESE MUST BE REMOVED PRIOR TO CONTINUING USE**.

- 7. **DISCONNECT** all external shore power.
- 8. Fully retract the leveling system and refrain from using while in storage.
- 9. Ensure all water tanks and water lines are drained.
- 10. Flush all holding tanks including the freshwater tank, gray tank, black tank, and the water heater.
- 11. Winterize the water system.

#### **Please see plumbing winterizing instructions in Section 21.**

- 12. Use the main battery disconnect to disconnect all 12V power. Remove the battery from the RV and place on a battery maintainer for proper storage.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Before winter months, ensure the RV's plumbing system is winterized. Failure to do so may result in frozen pipes and costly damages.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Damage caused or created by rodents or insects is not warrantable. Please take proper measures to prevent infestation or entry.

## R. SNOW REMOVAL

Throughout winter months, snow should be continuously removed from the top of your RV to help prevent possible damage from occurring.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Excessive snow and ice [8"+ (20.32 cm +) of snow or 2"+ (5.08 cm +) of ice] place additional stress and weight on the RV roof that should be removed

immediately. This weight can be detrimental to the materials and structure of the RV. Continuously remove snow and ice as needed. Upon removing, do so with care to prevent damage to the roof, seals, vents, and appliances.
