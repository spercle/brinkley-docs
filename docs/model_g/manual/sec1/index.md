# SEC.01 **INTRODUCTION**


## A. ABOUT THIS MANUAL

The Brinkley RV Owner's Manual is intended to safely guide you through the proper use and maintenance of your Brinkley RV along with its unique components and features. Understanding the operational procedures of your Brinkley RV will allow you to better understand how to use your RV and, in turn, maximize your RV experience.

Please know, this manual is not intended to be inclusive of every and all operational aspects of your RV. The separate component and appliance owner's manuals should also be thoroughly reviewed. Because there are various options that may be selected within the build of each RV, each Brinkley RV may contain options, features, and/or components that are not included on your RV.

We wish that we could provide you with all the information required to ensure your safety during towing, transportation, and camping. The campsites you choose, your tow vehicle, and the road conditions you encounter along your journey are too numerous for us to cover all the potential scenarios.

!!! warning "Attention"
    **You are ultimately responsible for the safe use, operation, and transportation of your RV.**


If you have questions related to safety, please contact us. We will gladly provide you with additional guidance related to your specific camping and transportation scenarios.

Additionally, due to our dedication to continuous product improvements and updates, some photographs, components, systems, and diagrams may be different from what is supplied within this manual. If we can make our products better, we will strive to make those improvements as quickly as humanly possible.

## B. OWNER INFORMATION PACKAGE

Within your RV, you will find an Owner's Information Package that contains the Owner's Manual, Warranty Guide, Component Manuals, and Warranty Registrations for the appliances and components within your new Brinkley RV.

- **Before Using Your RV,** it is vital you read all documents within the Owner's Information Package. Your safety is important to us, and we want you to have the best possible experience with your Brinkley RV.

!!! quote "Notice"
    **Some component manuals will not be provided within your Owner's Information Package and can only be found online via the component supplier website.**

- **Register and activate your component warranties** within the required time frame to avoid loss of warranty coverage. Please note that there are some component manufacturers who provide additional warranties beyond that of the Brinkley RV Limited Base and Structural Warranties. Please See **Section 4** in the separate Warranty Guide for additional details.


!!! quote "Notice"
    **It is highly recommended that you have your selling Dealer register your warranties. It is their obligation to register your warranties on your behalf at the time of sale. Failing to register your warranties may prevent you from utilizing the benefits of SafeRide prior to registration. See **Section 3(D)2**. Additionally, registering at the time of sale ensures that you are afforded the full benefit of all warranties.**

## C. MANUFACTURING CERTIFICATION

All Brinkley RVs are required to meet and/or exceed the safety and manufacturing codes, regulations, and standards of the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA).

- RVIA and Transport Canada both conduct random product audits on a frequent basis to ensure that all Brinkley RV's are manufactured to U.S. (RVIA) and Canadian (CSA) standards.

- Depending on where the RV is being transported and sold, an RVIA and/or CSA Group label can be found on the sidewall next to the main entry door. This label confirms that your RV has been manufactured to the required codes and standards of RVIA and/or CSA.

!!! quote "Notice"
    The RVIA and CSA Codes and standards are not identical and can vary from each other depending on their requirements.

**Content within the Brinkley RV Owner's Information Package including the Owner's Manual, Warranty Guide, Component Manuals, etc. should be considered a permanent component of the RV. In the event this RV is traded or sold, all documents should remain within the RV for the next owner.** 


## D. VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
!!! quote inline end "Notice"
    The last seven (7) digits of the VIN are also known as the RV serial number. For example, using the supplied VIN below, the serial number would be **2000001**.a

Each Brinkley RV is assigned a 17-digit vehicle identification number also referred to as the "VIN." This identification number is located on the VIN tag which can be found on the A-frame of a travel trailer or the hitch (also known as the pin box) on fifth wheels. As a secondary location, the VIN can also be found on the Federal Certification Label See **Section 5C(3)**.
