## A. ABOUT THIS MANUAL

The Brinkley RV Owner's Manual is intended to safely guide you through the proper use and maintenance of your Brinkley RV along with its unique components and features. Understanding the operational procedures of your Brinkley RV will allow you to better understand how to use your RV and, in turn, maximize your RV experience.

Please know, this manual is not intended to be inclusive of every and all operational aspects of your RV. The separate component and appliance owner's manuals should also be thoroughly reviewed. Because there are various options that may be selected within the build of each RV, each Brinkley RV may contain options, features, and/or components that are not included on your RV.

We wish that we could provide you with all the information required to ensure your safety during towing, transportation, and camping. The campsites you choose, your tow vehicle, and the road conditions you encounter along your journey are too numerous for us to cover all the potential scenarios.

#### **You are ultimately responsible for the safe use, operation, and transportation of your RV.**

If you have questions related to safety, please contact us. We will gladly provide you with additional guidance related to your specific camping and transportation scenarios.

Additionally, due to our dedication to continuous product improvements and updates, some photographs, components, systems, and diagrams may be different from what is supplied within this manual. If we can make our products better, we will strive to make those improvements as quickly as humanly possible.
