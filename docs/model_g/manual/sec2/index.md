# SEC.02 REPORTING SAFETY DEFECTS

## A. HOW TO REPORT SAFETY DEFECTS

To ensure safety, from time to time, a recall may be initiated to prevent a possible product failure from manifesting into something greater. A Safety Recall includes any possible malfunction that may lead to personal injury and/or property damage. If a recall is deemed necessary, a notice will be mailed to your address on file and emailed, if an email address has been provided by you. Please be sure that you supply Brinkley RV with an accurate home address and email address. The purpose of this process is to ensure you are notified of the recall and to ensure the RV is taken to a Brinkley Authorized Dealer or Service Center for correction prior to continuing use. For instructions on how to update your contact information, please see [**Section 3G**](../sec3/index.md) of this manual.

!!! notice
    It is very important to keep your contact information updated. It is also vital for the unit to be taken to an Authorized Dealer or Service Center to remedy the concern prior to using the RV or related component again.

If you believe your vehicle may contain a defect that can lead to injury, accident, property damage, or death, both Brinkley RV and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), should be notified immediately.

In the circumstance NHTSA receives multiple complaints on an issue, an investigation will be opened for review. This is to assist in the determination process required to locate the safety concern and to launch a recall and a remedy campaign (if needed). If NHTSA finds that a safety defect exists in any group of RV's, it may order a recall and require a remedy campaign. Once a recall is established, NHTSA cannot become involved with any action or circumstance between you, the Dealer, and/or Brinkley RV.

All communications related to the recall must be handled by Brinkley RV, your Dealer, and you as the owner of the RV.

A Service Campaign may also be launched for a potential product failure. Unlike a recall, a Service Campaign is less severe in that the product failure is not likely to lead to personal injury. And, unlike a recall, the correction process for a Service Campaign is not mandatory but is highly recommended.

Recalls and Service Campaigns can be found on the NHTSA website. As a reminder, this information will also be mailed to the contact information on the RV file.
