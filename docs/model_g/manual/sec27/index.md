## A. CLEANING THE INTERIOR

To increase the life of the RV, maintenance should be performed on a regular basis following the proper care procedures. In addition to this manual, please follow all instructions contained within the manufacturer's provided manuals.

!!! quote "Notice"
    Only cleaning products recommended within the manufacturer's manuals and this manual should be used on your RV. Using improper chemicals and cleaning agents may result in surface damage within the RV. Always test a small, inconspicuous area with the cleaning agent before using upon the entire surface. Contact your Dealer or Brinkley RV Customer Care for additional information and assistance.

!!! warning
    **NEVER use flammable agents or sprays to clean your RV.**

## B. TABLES, CABINETS, AND DRAWERS

- Regularly dust all hardwood surfaces including cabinet doors and drawers, tables, and cabinet fronts using a soft cloth and cleaning polish or mild recommended solution.
- Do not use silicone oils or ammonia-based products on any surface. Prolonged use will result in damage to the surfaces.
- Clean accidental spills as they occur.
- Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, high humidity, extreme cold, or high temperatures. Extreme conditions may result in damage to finish and/or wood products.

## C. WALL, CEILING, AND CABINET PANELING

- Use a solution of a mild soap and warm water.
- Always use a soft cloth or sponge.
- Refrain from using harsh cleaning agents as they may dull the surface color or cause micro-scratching. Always test cleaning agent in an inconspicuous area first.
- If a more aggressive cleaner is needed for stubborn dirt or grease, use an all-purpose cleaner.

## D. COUNTERTOPS

The main countertops in the RV are made of porcelain. Special care must be exercised to prevent permanent damage to the countertop edges and surfaces as follows:

- **ALWAYS** use hot protective pads under any hot pans, dishes, or heat producing appliances.
- **NEVER** use a knife or sharp object directly on the countertops. ALWAYS utilize a cutting board.
- **NEVER** use harsh chemicals or cleaners (i.e., drain cleaners, oven cleaners, grease removers, etc.).
- **NEVER** mix bleach and other cleaning agents.

Many commercial surface cleaners and cleaning solutions can be used to remove residue and dirt. Avoid the use of window cleaners as many glass solutions leave a waxy buildup that will dull the surface appearance. Utilize a damp microfiber cloth to clean the surface and dry with a dry microfiber cloth or towel to remove residual cleaner left behind. All countertops should be disinfected on a regular basis. This can be accomplished with disinfectant wipes or diluted household bleach (100:1, one hundred parts water to one part bleach).

## E. VINYL FLOORING

Always test a small, inconspicuous area with the cleaning agent prior to using on the entire surface. If the surface dulls or pulls, discontinue use immediately to prevent further damage. Please see the cleaning guide on the next page for further instructions.
