HOW TO REPORT SAFETY DEFECTS","text":"<p>To ensure safety, from time to time, a recall may be initiated to prevent a possible product failure from manifesting into something greater. A Safety Recall includes any possible malfunction that may lead to personal injury and/or property damage. If a recall is deemed necessary, a notice will be mailed to your address on file and emailed, if an email address has been provided by you. Please be sure that you supply Brinkley RV with an accurate home address and email address. The purpose of this process is to ensure you are notified of the recall and to ensure the RV is taken to a Brinkley Authorized Dealer or Service Center for correction prior to continuing use. For instructions on how to update your contact information, please see Section 3G of this manual.</p> <p>Notice</p> <p>It is very important to keep your contact information updated. It is also vital for the unit to be taken to an Authorized Dealer or Service Center to remedy the concern prior to using the RV or related component again.</p> <p>If you believe your vehicle may contain a defect that can lead to injury, accident, property damage, or death, both Brinkley RV and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), should be notified immediately.</p> <p>In the circumstance NHTSA receives multiple complaints on an issue, an investigation will be opened for review. This is to assist in the determination process required to locate the safety concern and to launch a recall and a remedy campaign (if needed). If NHTSA finds that a safety defect exists in any group of RV's, it may order a recall and require a remedy campaign. Once a recall is established, NHTSA cannot become involved with any action or circumstance between you, the Dealer, and/or Brinkley RV.</p> <p>All communications related to the recall must be handled by Brinkley RV, your Dealer, and you as the owner of the RV.</p> <p>A Service Campaign may also be launched for a potential product failure. Unlike a recall, a Service Campaign is less severe in that the product failure is not likely to lead to personal injury. And, unlike a recall, the correction process for a Service Campaign is not mandatory but is highly recommended.</p> <p>Recalls and Service Campaigns can be found on the NHTSA website. As a reminder, this information will also be mailed to the contact information on the RV file.</p> <p>TO CONTACT NHTSA IN THE UNITED STATES:</p> <p>Please visit their website at www.safercar.gov; call their toll-free hotline at 1 (888) 327-4236 (Hearing impaired (TTY): 1 (800) 424-9153); or send your correspondence to:</p> <p>NHTSA Headquarters Attn: Administrator 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE Washington, DC 20590</p> <p>TO CONTACT NHTSA IN CANADA: (Known as \"Transport Canada\")</p> <p>Please visit their website at www.tc.gc.ca; call their toll-free hotline at 1 (800) 333-0510 (819) 994-3328 in the Gatineau-Ottawa area or internationally, or send your correspondence to:**</p> <p>Transport Canada-ASFAD 330 Sparks St. Ottawa, ON K1A 0N5</p> <p>BRINKLEY CUSTOMER CARE: phone: 888.502.3460 or 574.501.4280 / email: CustomerCare@BrinkleyRV.com</p> <p>SAFERIDE 24/7 - EMERGENCY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE: 888.482.5715 / Customer Service: 855.963.1770</p>"},{"location":"model_g/manual/sec25/","title":"SEC.25 ACCESSORIES","text":""},{"location":"model_g/manual/sec25/#a-interior-accessories","title":"A.

Verify your complaint. There is nothing more frustrating than transporting your RV to your Dealer just to find out your RV is operating correctly, is functioning within normal conditions of the RV, or was not used correctly. There are many instances where your Dealer or Brinkley RV can help you before you become frustrated and spend time trying to obtain service.</li> <li>2. Make a list. If service is truly required, you should also make a prioritized list of all repairs needed and provide this list to the Dealer or Authorized Service Center at the time of scheduling service. We want to ensure that the Dealer or Authorized Service Center schedules enough time to address all your service concerns and they can obtain all necessary parts in advance of your service appointment. The checklist will also help to ensure that the Dealer addresses all your concerns at the time of service.</li> </ul> <p>Notice</p> <p>It is very common for service to be delayed due to the parts not being available at the time of service. RV Dealers generally carry many different brands and models of RV's making it difficult to stock all parts required for service. Some replacement parts may take several weeks for the Dealer or Authorized Service Center to obtain. The better you communicate your service needs, the better your service experience will be.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>3. Be prepared. Prior to calling your Dealer or Brinkley RV, make sure you have your warranty list prepared, the VIN, and any related past service/maintenance paperwork available.

Holiday schedules may also impact scheduling time.</li> </ul> <p>Notice</p> <p>To improve efficiency, any time you reach out to your Dealer or Brinkley RV, please have the name of the individual on the registration, your RV's 17-digit Vehicle Identification Number (located on the A-frame of a travel trailer and on the hitch of a fifth wheel), date of purchase, and a detailed description of your complaint(s).</p> <ul> <li>5. Drop off your RV. Dealers will ask for your RV to be dropped off. This will give them time to properly verify your complaint, identify the cause, and make the correction. Note that there are also instances where service may be able to be performed by a mobile technician. Calling ahead to confirm whether drop-off is required will save you time and reduce frustration.</li> <li>6. Inspect your RV at pick-up. Prior to picking up your unit, inspect all repairs thoroughly. It is vital to address any concerns or dissatisfaction immediately. You should feel empowered to ask as many questions as you have related to your RV service as your satisfaction is of the utmost importance.

It is critical to always know and adhere to the restrictions in place for your location. Forest and field fires can be catastrophic to safety and property alike and can quickly spread.</li> <li>ALWAYS maintain at least a three (3) feet of clearance around grills, campfires, your RV, tents, and other structures or combustible materials. This three (3) foot zone should be free of leaves, dry grass, pine needles, or any other combustible substances to prevent the spread of fire.</li> <li>ALWAYS proactively have an action plan in place to rapidly and completely extinguish a campfire or other open flame.</li> <li>ALWAYS teach family members and RV occupants how to locate and properly use the fire extinguisher.</li> <li>ALWAYS replace your fire extinguisher as recommended by the manufacturer of the extinguisher.</li> <li>ALWAYS call the Fire Department, no matter how small the fire may seem.</li> <li>ALWAYS assume that, where there is smoke, there may be fire.</li> <li>NEVER store combustible materials in enclosed areas or near any heat source.</li> <li>NEVER leave a fire burning unattended. An ember or unextinguished cigarette can cause a fire to quickly spread out of control during dry conditions.</li> <li>NEVER use water to put out a grease or electrical fire.
